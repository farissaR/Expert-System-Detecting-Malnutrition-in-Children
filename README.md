# Expert-System-Detecting-Malnutrition-in-Children
This is a web based expert system for detecting malnutrition in children using certainty factors method

#Research Background
Malnutrition is an imbalance intake of nutrients the body needs, both
deficient and excess. The impact of malnutrition are the disruption of body
development and decrease intelligence. The nutritional problem condition of the
Bontang City public is in the acute-chronic category with a stunted prevalence of
32.4% and wasting prevalence of 8.2% based on Pemantauan Status Gizi (PSG)
data in 2017.

Child nutrition monitoring is carried out through the Kartu Menuju Sehat
(KMS) and done once a month at the Posyandu, but some very important growth
indicators in recognizing child nutrition problems are not listed in the Kartu Menuju
Sehat. This study aims to design an expert system that can detect the condition of
malnutrition using the Certainty Factors method that works using expert
knowledge. The three conditions of malnutrition detected by the system are obesity,
wasting and stunted.

The testing of 100 primary data obtained through interview process was
conducted to assess system performance. The sensitivity test showed 100% results,
the specificity test showed 89.85% results and the accuracy test showed 93%. The
system can detect the condition of malnutrition quickly and efficiently to help
paramedics to detect malnutrition in a short time. Blackbox testing was carried out
on 4 test cases with 3 respondents that have shown similarity between expected
results and the actual results that indicate the system is running as expected.
